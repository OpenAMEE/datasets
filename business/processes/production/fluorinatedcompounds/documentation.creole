  The AMEE category at business/processes/production/fluorinatedcompounds provides a methodology for calculating emissions of fluorinated compounds (FC) associated with their production. See the following subcategories for further details.

===Production-based methodology===
The AMEE category at [[Generic_fluorinated_compound_production|business/processes/production/fluorinatedcompounds]] provides a methodology for calculating emissions of fluorinated compounds (FC) associated with their production, based on default emissions factors relating to the production of HFC's, PFC's and SF,,6,,. Users have the option of returning absolute quantity of emissions, or - by specifying the particular type of FC fluid used - returning the emissions expressed as CO,,2,,e. This methodology represents the //Tier 1// approach described by the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories ([[http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/vol3.html|NGGIP]]).
