** This category is deprecated. The latest DEFRA methodology for car transport //by size// can be found [[DEFRA_road_transport_methodology_by_vehicle_size|here]] .**

    This category allows users to calculate greenhouse gas emissions from a car journey from indicating the car's size. The methodology follows the latest [[http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/business/reporting/conversion-factors.htm|Defra]] emission factors and advice. 

==How to use this category==

There are two drill-downs in this category. Use the drill-down //**fuel**// to select the fuel used by the vehicle from the following options.

* //petrol//

* //diesel//

* //petrol hybrid//

* //lpg//

* //cng//

* //average// - for use if //fuel// is unknown

The second drill-down, //**size**//, selects the approximate size of the vehicle. Select from the following options.

* //small//

* //medium//

* //large//

* //average// - for use if //**fuel**// is unknown

The //small// option only exists for //**petrol**// and //**diesel**// cars.

The //**distance**// must then be entered as a profile item value. There are four further optional profile item values, //**occupants**//, //**ownFuelConsumption**//, //**numberOfJourneys**// and //**totalFuelConsumed**//. 

The //**occupants**// profile item value is used to enter the number of people in the car for the selected journey (default 1). The emissions are then divided by the number of occupants in order to return the fraction of the emissions due to each person. The //**ownFuelConsumption**// can be entered if the user has a reliable value for their vehicles fuel consumption (default units of km/L). If this is entered then it overrides AMEE's default emission factors for the selected vehicle. The algorithm then divides the fuel emission factor, from the [[Fuel_Defra]] category, by the users //**ownFuelConsumption**// and multiplies by the distance. The //**numberOfJourneys**// profile item value (default 1) can be used if the specified journey has been repeated a number of times; the emissions for one journey are multiplied by this value. Finally, //**totalFuelConsumed**// can be entered if the volume of fuel used for the entire journey is known. In this case the volume of fuel is multiplied by the appropriate emission factor in the [[Fuel_Defra]] category.

==Algorithm==

If no fuel consumption information entered

CO2eEmissionFactor = CO2EF + CO2eEFForN2O + CO2eEFForCH4

CO2e = CO2eEmissionFactor * distance * numberOfJourneys / occupants

If //**ownFuelConsumption**// entered

CO2eEmissionFactor from business/energy/fuel

CO2e = (CO2eEmissionFactor / ownFuelConsumption) * (distance / occupants) * numberOfJourneys

If //**totalFuelConsumed**// entered

CO2eEmissionFactor from business/energy/fuel

CO2e = CO2eEmissionFactor * totalFuelConsumed 

The algorithm returns a value of kgCO,,2,,e for the particular journey, per occupant. This value includes contributions from carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane.
