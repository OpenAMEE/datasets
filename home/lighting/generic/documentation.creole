   This methodology enables the calculation of greenhouse gas emissions associated with the use of internal lighting. This category is based on typical energy consumption //per year// of light bulbs, together with emissions data associated with grid electricity production and consumption. Currently, this category contains data applicable to the United Kingdom.

To make a calculation, select a location and a type of light bulb ('standard' or 'low energy') using the //**location**// and //**type**// drill choice. Next, specify the number of light bulbs using the //**number**// parameter. The returned value represents annual CO,,2,, emissions associated with this number of bulbs, based on typical annual energy consumption per bulb and the emissions factors for electricity generation and consumption in the specified location (i.e. the //location// drill choice).

==Overriding the location==
This category uses two location-dependent values for calculating greenhouse gas emissions: (1) a value for 'typical' annual energy consumption per light bulb; and (2) an emissions factor for grid electricity generation to convert this energy consumption into a quantity of greenhouse gas emissions. Both values correspond with the location indicated by the //location// drill choice. In the case of the location-specific grid electricity emissions factor, users can override the default location and specify an alternative country, with AMEE applying the appropriate emissions factor. It should be understood, however, that this approach involves combining the 'typical' energy consumption habits of one location with the electricity generation and consumption properties of another.

To set a different location, set the country name or ISO code in the //**country**// parameter. In this case, AMEE will lookup the appropriate grid electricity emissions factor from the [[Electricity_by_country|this dataset]]. If calculations are stored using profiles, the country can be specified within the profile [[metadata]]. Users should note, however, that directly specified **//country//** parameters override any set as profile metadata.
