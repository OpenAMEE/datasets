Human powered transport such as walking and cycling produces no direct carbon dioxide emission. Propellants used by Ariane 5 and the space shuttle produce no carbon dioxide. Although both do use hypergolic propellant which does produces carbon dioxide, it is generally used in relatively small quantities for post-launch manoeuvring, well-above any layers of the atmosphere that are relevant to climate change.
