 This section allows the user to get a rough idea of how much rainforest is required to absorb a given amount of CO,,2,, emissions. Because there is considerable uncertainty regarding the CO,,2,, absorption rate of rainforest, we anticipate including several choices of value in this category. The drill-down //**sourceName**// is used in this category to chose which source the user would prefer to use in the calculations. At present the only option for this drill-down is //Save the Rainforest//.

The user then enters either //**co2Quantity**// or //**rainforestArea**// as profile item values. If the area of rainforest is entered then AMEE returns an amount of CO,,2,, as usual. This is the amount of CO,,2,, that would be absorbed by that area of rainforest in one year. When storing calculations via profiles, if the amount of CO,,2,, is entered then AMEE returns the area of rainforest (in km²) that would take one year to absorb that amount of CO,,2,, in the profile item value //**rainforestArea**//.

The value with //**sourceName**//=//Save the Rainforest// is provided by the Princes Rainforest Project and Save the Rainforests. It should be treated as being indicative only as several important assumptions have been made, for example, concerning the latitude and climate of the forest's location, which are significant in determining the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed.
