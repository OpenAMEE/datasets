 Bus generic US biomass fuel data is from the [[http://www.ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools/all-tools|GHGP worksheet]] GHG emissions from transport or mobile sources v2.0. This category allows users to calculate their biomass CO,,2,, emissions separately from the fossil fuel CO,,2,,, N,,2,,O and CH,,4,, emissions which can be calculated using the [[US_bus_transport|US bus transport]] category. 


The user selects the drill-down //fuelType// to select the type of fuel being used. At present the only option for biomass fuels in this category is //ethanol//. The //distance// is then set as a profile item by the user.


The algorithm returns the kg CO,,2,, for the distance entered. This CO,,2,, value covers biomass emissions only. CH,,4,, and N,,2,,O emissions for ethanol-powered bus travel are included in the [[US_bus_transport|US bus transport]] category. If the user wishes to calculate complete emissions, including biomass CO,,2,, emissions, both categories must be used.
