   The AMEE category transport/plane/specific/military contains data on the fuel consumption and CO,,2,, emissions of several aircraft types associated with the military, sourced from the [[http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/EMEPCORINAIR5/page017.html|EMEP/CORINAIR Emission Inventory Guidebook (2007)]].

To use this category select the aircraft //type// and //subtype// using drill downs and set the flying duration by using the **//flightDuration//** profile item value. The returned value represents CO,,2,, emissions for the total flight time.

The specific aircraft on which each profile item is based is described in the //representativeAircraft// data item.


==Radiative Forcing Index==
Users can elect to incorporate the effects of radiative forcing by setting the **//useRFI//** profile item value to "//true//", and entering a value for RFI in the  **//radiativeForcingIndex//** profile item value. If no value is entered in the **//radiativeForcingIndex//** profile item value, a default factor of 1.9 will be applied. For more information on radiative forcing, see the [[Radiative_Forcing_Index|here]].
