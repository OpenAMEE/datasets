      The AMEE category /transport/taxi/generic contains a single representative vehicle type, based on the 'large, diesel' vehicle used in the [[Generic_car_transport|Generic car]] category, and returns emissions on a //per vehicle// basis. For //per passenger// emissions, see the subcategories below.


To use this category, specify the taxi type using //type// drill option (there currently exists only one choice here: 'typical'). Next, specify the distance travelled using the **//distance//** profile item value. The value returned represents the total CO,,2,, emissions associated with taxi transport across the distance specified.
