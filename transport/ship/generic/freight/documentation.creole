 The AMEE category /transport/ship/generic/freight contains data on the greenhouse gas emissions associated with ship transported freight sourced from the UK government agency [[http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/business/reporting/pdf/ghg-cf-guidelines2008.pdf|DEFRA]]. The following [[Ship_freighting_GHGP|Ship freighting GHGP]] subcategories provide ship-based freighting methodologies representing other geographic contexts sourced from the World Resources Institute [[http://www.ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools/all-tools|Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHGP)]]:

To use this category, select the type of ship using the //type// drill down option.

Next, specify the distance and mass of the freight transported by setting the **//distance//** and **//mass//** profile item values. The returned value represents the mass of CO,,2,, emitted in association with the specified freighting.
