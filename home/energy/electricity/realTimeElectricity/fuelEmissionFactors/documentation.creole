  This category contains CO,,2,, emissions factors for each electricity generation method used to supply grid electricity. It is a look-up category and so profile items should not be created inside it.

The //**kgCO2PerKWh**// figures give the CO,,2,, emitted per kWh generated. This does not necessarily equal the amount supplied to the grid because some energy is used inside generation facilities. The //**generatedToSuppliedGrossFactor**// is the fraction of the generated energy that is supplied to the grid. [[Real_Time_Electricity]] gives more detail on this point.
