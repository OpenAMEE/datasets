  The AMEE category /transport/emissionscontrol/ureabasedadditives contains a methodology for caluclating non-combustive CO,,2,, emissions from urea-based additives in catalytic converters, sourced from the IPCC [[http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/|Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories]].

To use this this category, create a profile item (this category contains no drill options) and set the quantity of urea-based additive consumed using the //**mass**// profile item value, and specify its purity using the //**purity**// profile item value. 'Purity' refers to the fraction of urea within the additive and should be expressed as a value between 0-1.

The calculation for non-combustive CO,,2,, emissions is as follows:

CO,,2,, emissions = quantity consumed x (12/60) x (44/12) x purity

The value 12/60 represents the proportion of carbon (C), by weight, in urea (CO(NH,,2,,),,2,,), while the value 44/12 represents the weight of CO,,2,, relative to C.
