  This category allows the calculation of greenhouse gas emissions from the production of cement using the cement-based methodology. This method is based on the U.S. EPA's ClimateWise program (ICF 1999).

Use the drill-down cement //**type**// and enter the profile item values listed below in order to calculate the emissions for the selected cement

==Algorithm==

//**CO,,2,, emissions**// = //cement quantity * clinker content * raw material quantity * CaCO3 ratio * 0.44//

The factor 0.44 is the CO,,2,, to CaCO3 stoichiometric ratio.
