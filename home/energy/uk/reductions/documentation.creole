  This data represents actions that result in reductions of CO,,2,, emissions. These tips make broad assumptions about typical usage of various items in the UK. Given detailed information from the user, it is possible to generate more specific CO,,2,, reductions using data in other categories. For example, if you know how many normal light bulbs a user has, then the data in the [[lighting]] category can be used to calculate the kgCO,,2,, reduction in changing all those lightbulbs to low energy ones.
