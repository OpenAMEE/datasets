    The AMEE category /business/agriculture/livestock contains data and methodologies for calculating greenshouse gas emissions associated with the keeping of livestock, sourced from the IPCC [[http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/pdf/4_Volume4/V4_05_Ch5_Cropland.pdf|Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories]].

Two main subcategories of emissions are currently available:

==Enteric fermentation==
The AMEE category [[Enteric_fermentation|/business/agriculture/livestock/entericfermentation]] provides data and emissions calculations relating to digestive fermentation for various types of livestock.

==Manure management ==
The AMEE category [[Manure_management|/business/agriculture/livestock/manure]] provides data and emissions calculations relating to the management and treatment of manure for various types of livestock and management systems.
