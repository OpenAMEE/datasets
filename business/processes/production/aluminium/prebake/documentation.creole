    AMEE provides two methodologies for calculating emissions from aluminium manufacture using the prebake process.

* [[Aluminium_prebake_electrolysis|Prebake (electrolysis)]] - this category provides data and two calculation methodologies for CO,,2,, emissions from prebake cells (Centre-Worked Prebake (CWPB), Side-Worked Prebake (SWPB)). This category represents //Tiers 2 and 3// approach under the IPCC guideliines.

* [[Aluminium_prebake_pitchcooking|Prebake (pitch cooking)]] - this category provides data and two calculation methodologies for CO,,2,, emissions relating to //pitch volatiles combustion// and //bake furnace paking material//. This category represents //Tiers 2 and 3// under the IPCC guideliines.

Both methodologies need to be used in order to estimate total CO,,2,, emissions from the prebake process.
