This methodology contains energy consumption and CO,,2,, emissions data associated with several generic types and ranges of screen sizes of television.

To use this methodology, select the television type and screen size using the //**type**// and //**size**// drill choices. Next set the number of hours for which the television is on, using the //**hoursOn**// parameter. The returned value represents CO,,2,, emissions associated with the specified television usage. 

By default, emissions are calculated on the basis on the emissions intensity of the UK electricity grid. If calculations are stored using profiles, an alternative country can be specified within the profile [[metadata]].

===Standby===
Also in the case where calculations are stored using profiles, if the //standby// item in the [[Entertainment_generic|/home/appliances/entertainment/generic]] category has been set, any profile items created in this category will incorporate an estimate of emissions associated with the specified level of standby usage, i.e. //emissions reflect those associated with both full power and standby usage//.
