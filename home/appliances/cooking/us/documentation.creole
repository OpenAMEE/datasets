This methodology contains energy consumption and CO,,2,, emissions data associated with the use of domestic cooking hobs and ovens in the United States.

To use this methodology, select the heat source type (i.e. cooktop, oven or range) using the //**cookerType**// drill choice and the fuel type using the **//fuelType//** drill choice. Next set the number of people in the household using the //**numberOfPeople**// parameter. If calculations are stored using profiles, this value can be set in the profile [[metadata]]. If this value is not specified, a default of 1 is assumed.

By default, emissions for electric and induction hobs are calculated on the basis on the emissions intensity of the United States electricity grid. If calculations are stored using profiles, an alternative country can be specified within the profile [[metadata]]. The emission factors for electricity, based on the country supplied in the profile metadata, can be found in [[Electricity_by_country|here]] and [[Electricity_by_country_ISO_code|here]]. The emissions factor for gas this taken from [[Energy_by_Quantity|this dataset]].  

**Note:** This category uses US emission factors by default, but in the absence of usage values for US homes, it assumes values typical for the UK. As such the provenance of this category is //recommended// rather than //enterprise//.
