    The AMEE category /business/agriculture/soil/inputs contains a methodology for calculating the N,,2,,O emissions associated with the application of nitrogen to managed soils, sourced from the IPCC [[http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/pdf/4_Volume4/V4_11_Ch11_N2O&CO2.pdf|Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories]].

Two subcategories are available and contain data for animal-associated nitrogen inputs (i.e. urine and dung) and inputs from other organic and synthetic fertilizers. Both methodologies incorporate direct and indirect (leaching, volatilisation) emissions associated with each source. See the appropriate subcategories for further details.
