  The AMEE category at /business/processes/production/titaniumdioxide provides methodologies for calculating greenhouse gas emissions associated with the production of titanium dioxide. See the following subcategories for further details.

===Generic calculation===
The AMEE category at [[Generic_titanium_dioxide_production|/business/processes/production/lime/production/titaniumdioxide/production]] provides a methodology based upon generic emissions factors for CO,,2,, emissions per quantity of titanium oxide produced. This methodology represents the //Tier 1// approach described by the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories ([[http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/vol3.html|NGGIP]]). 

===Feedstock-based calculation===
The AMEE category at [[Titanium_dioxide_production_feedstock_methodology|business/processes/production/titaniumdioxide/consumption]] provides a methodology based on a mass-balance approach taking into consideration the carbon content of process feedstocks. This methodology is sourced from the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories ([[http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/vol3.html|NGGIP]]) and represents the //Tier 2// approach.
