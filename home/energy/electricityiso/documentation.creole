  The data in this category is used to determine the emission factor to apply to electrical device usage based on the country specified in the metadata profile item, defaulting to the United Kingdom value if not specified.

This is a duplicate of data in [[Electricity_by_country]]; the only difference is that this data is named using country [[http://www.iso.org/iso/country_codes/iso_3166_code_lists/english_country_names_and_code_elements.htm|ISO 3166]] codes.

The country value in the metadata profile item can be specified by two letter ISO code.
