  AMEE provides two methodologies for calculating CO,,2,, emissions associated with the production of cement sourced from the WRI Greenhouse Gas protocol [[http://www.ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools/all-tools|worksheets]].

* [[Cement_CSI|CSI]] - a clinker-based methodology based on the Cement Sustainability Initiative (CSI) guidelines

* [[Cement_EPA|EPA]] - an methodology based on carbonate inputs sourced from the US EPA's ClimateWise program

* [[IPCC_cement_methodologies|IPCC]] - three methodologies based on cement production, clinker produciton and carbonate inputs sourced from the IPCC-NGGIP
