    The AMEE category /business/processes/production/glass/carbonate contains data and a methodology for calculating the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the production of glass. 

The category uses specific quantities of various carbonate species - used as feedstock in the glass industry and the primary source of carbon - for calculating CO,,2,, emissions, and represents the IPCC //Tier 3// methodology.

To use this category, simply create a profile item (there are no drill options to specify). Next, specify the quantities of each carbonate mineral using the //**massCalcite**//, //**massMagnesite**//, //**massDolomite**//, //**massSiderite**//, //**massAnkerite**//, //**massRhodochrosite**//, and //**massSodaAsh**//, profile item values. Any carbonate types not used need not be specified. The calculation returns the quantity of CO,,2,, emitted assuming 100% calcination of each.

Users can override this assumption by specifying the actual calcination fraction (as a decimal between 0-1) using the //**fractionCalcite**//, //**fractionMagnesite**//, //**fractionDolomite**//, //**fractionSiderite**//, //**fractionAnkerite**//, //**fractionRhodochrosite**//, and  //**fractionSodaAsh**// profile item values.

**Note**: the stoichiometric ratio for Ankerite => CO,,2,, has be taken as the midpoint (0.44197) of the range (0.40822 − 0.47572) specified in the IPCC documentation.
