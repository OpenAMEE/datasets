  The AMEE category at business/processes/production/titaniumdioxide/consumption provides a methodology for calculating greenhouse gas emissions associated with the production of titanium dioxide. The methodology is based on a mass-balance approach taking into consideration the carbon content of process feedstocks. This methodology is sourced from the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories ([[http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/vol3.html|NGGIP]]) and represents the //Tier 2// approach.

To use this category, simply create a profile item - there are no drill choices.

Next, specify the quantity of feedstock consumed using the //**massFeedstock**// profile item value and the carbon content of the feedstock using the //**feedstockCarbon**// profile item value. Users can additionally specify the fraction oxidation achieved for the feedstock is appropriate using the //**feedstockOxidation**// profile item value (decimal fraction, i.e. 0-1), although this defaults to 1 (i.e. 100% oxidation) if left unspecified. 

The returned value represents CO,,2,, emissions associated with the consumption and properties of feedstock specified.
