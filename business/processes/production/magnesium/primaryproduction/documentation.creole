    The AMEE category business/processes/production/magnesium/primaryproduction/ is aimed towards industry professionals  to enable them to prepare inventories of greenhouse gas emissions from primary magnesium production. The magnesium-containing ores which release CO,,2,, during calcination are dolomite (MgCa(CO,,3,,),,2,,) and magnesite (MgCO,,3,,). AMEE provides theoretical emission factors for use in situations where facility or site-specific data is not available. The actual CO,,2,, emissions per kilogram magnesium produced will be higher than the theoretical emissions due to losses of magnesium in the process chain. The methodology provided by AMEE in this category represents the //Tier 1// (default values) and //Tier 2// (facility- or country-specific values) approaches described by the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories ([[http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/vol3.html|NGGIP]]).

==How to use this category==

AMEE allows the user to caculate emissions from the primary magnesium production from dolomite or from magnesite. Each of these exists as a drill-down option in this AMEE category, so can be calculated individually. To use this category use the //**magnesiumProductionByRawMaterial**// drill-down to select the raw material for magnesium production from the following options:

# //magnesite//
# //dolomite//

The only required profile item value is the quantity of magnesium produced, //**productQuantity**//. The emission factor for raw material has a default value provided by the AMEE engine, but this can be over-ridden, using the //**massCO2PerMassProduct**// profile item value, by the user if more precise site or country-specific values are known. Over-riding the default values represents the //Tier 2// approach described by the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories ([[http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/vol3.html|NGGIP]]) and should be used where users have facility-specific data.
