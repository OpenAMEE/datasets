 The metadata  hotel item is used to store profile information for hotels. For example, the facilities of the hotel, the number of rooms and the hotel rating. Most standard hotel facilities are included with a profile item starting with "has" - these can be set to either true or false.

All of these are for information only and do affect calculations elsewhere in the profile.
