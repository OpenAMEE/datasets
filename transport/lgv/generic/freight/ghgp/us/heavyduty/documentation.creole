**This category is deprecated. The Greenhouse Gas Protocol methodologies for freight transport can now be found [[Freight_transport_by_Greenhouse_Gas_Protocol|here]]**

    The AMEE category /transport/lgv/generic/freight/ghgp/us/heavyduty contains data on the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the heavy duty road transportation of freight in the US, sourced from the [[http://www.ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools/all-tools|WRI Greenhouse Gas Protocol]]. 

The calculation methodology uses //per distance, per mass// emissions factors, and thus emissions represent those associated with the road freighting of a specific quantity of freight.


To use this category, select the vehicle type and size using the //vehicleType// and //size// drill down options. Then, specify the distance and mass of the freight transported by setting the **//distance//** and **//mass//** profile item values. The value returned represents the total greenhouse gas emissions (CO,,2,,, CH,,4,,, N,,2,,O) associated with the specified freighting, expressed in terms of the mass of CO,,2,, which would produce an equivalent global warming effect.
