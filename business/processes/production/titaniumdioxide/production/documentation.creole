   The AMEE category at business/processes/production/lime/production/titaniumdioxide/production provides a methodology for calculating greenhouse gas emissions associated with titanium dioxide production. The methodology is based upon generic emissions factors for CO,,2,, emissions per quantity of titanium oxide produced. This methodology represents the //Tier 1// approach described by the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories ([[http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/vol3.html|NGGIP]]). If users have more specific data on the types and and properties of lime produced, they may want to use the //[[Titanium_dioxide_production_feedstock_methodology|Tier 2]]// methodology.

To use this category, select the type of titanium dioxide using the //product// drill choice.

Next, specify the quantity of titanium dioxide produced using the //**mass**// profile item value. The returned amount represents CO,,2,, emissions associated with this quantity, based on the default emissions factor for the type specified.

Users can override the default emissions factor and specify their own quantity for CO,,2,, emissions //per quantity of titanium dioxide produced// if facility-specific data are available. To set this value, use the //**massCO2PerMass**// profile item value. Users should note that, following IPCC methodology, the 'titanium slag' drill choice does not include a default emissions factor and therefore users of this option //must// specify their own using the //**massCO2PerMass**// profile item value.
