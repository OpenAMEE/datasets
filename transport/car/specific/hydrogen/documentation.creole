  The AMEE category transport/car/specific/hydrogen contains data on the CO,,2,, emissions associated with specific models of hydrogen powered car.


To use this category, use drill downs to specify the manufacturer (//manufacturer//) and model (//line//) of car and set the distance travelled using the **//distance//** profile item value. By default, the returned value will represent greenhouse gas emissions associated with the specified distance on a //per vehicle// basis. However, if the **//occupants//** profile item value is set to a positive integer (its default is -1), then the returned amount will be 'shared' among passengers and will represent emissions on a //per occupant// basis.
