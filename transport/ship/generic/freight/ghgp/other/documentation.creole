**This category is deprecated. The Greenhouse Gas Protocol methodologies for ship freighting can now be found [[Freight_transport_by_Greenhouse_Gas_Protocol|/here]]**

  The AMEE category /transport/ship/generic/freight/ghgp/other contains data on the greenhouse gas emissions associated with ship transported freight for non-US/UK geographic contexts, sourced from the World Resources Institute [[http://www.ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools/all-tools|Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHGP)]].


To use this category, select the type of ship using the //type// drill down option, and specify the size using the //size// drill option. 


Next, specify the distance and mass of the freight transported by setting the **//distance//** and **//mass//** profile item values. The returned value represents the mass of CO,,2,, emitted in association with the specified freighting. In the GHGP subcategories the returned value also incorporates CH,,4,, and N,,2,,O emissions, all expressed together as the mass of CO,,2,, which would provide an equivalent global warming effect.
